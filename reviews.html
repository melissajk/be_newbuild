                    I haven't had a massage since pre-Covid and my body was telling me it was time to return to massage. Gene at Body Elemental was recommended by a current client, and so glad he was.

                  <p>
                    Gene listened to what I was experiencing and was very educational in describing what might be going on. I asked for deep tissue massage and Gene was great at finding the right pressure for me working out the kinks, made a huge difference.

                    Would definitely recommend.

                  I woke up with a large knot in my lower back. I have never had a knot that actually caused me pain. This was ruining my entire week. I finally found someone that had availability. He was amazing. You can tell he is very knowledgeable and knew exactly what to do. I was shocked at how fast I felt better. I highly recommend him.

                  I just had a 90 min massage from Gene last night and it was amazing. He was referred to me by two close friends. I am very picky with massages and usually it is not strong enough. Gene was great. He listened to my concerns, checked in from time to time to make sure the pressure was ok and stretched me out when I needed it most. I was so relaxed after the massage and feel great this am. Thank you Gene! I will now start using you every two weeks.

                  Ten stars if I could. I've been going to massage therapy for a few years due to problems with my neck and shoulders, and because of my work schedule I recently had to find a new therapist in Phoenix rather than where I live near Tucson. Gene is a highly experienced (22 years!) therapist that totally exceeded my expectations in every way. Knowledgeable and a master at his craft doesn't even begin to describe it -- whatever is ailing your muscles and frame, Gene is likely to have a solution. I had my first session last week and have already book several weeks out.

                  Gene is not just a massage therapist.. He's a healer.
                  I started visiting Gene for therapy sessions after I lost a great deal of weight. His massages helped to firm and tone my skin, as well as reduce water retention. In fact, after one particular therapy session, I spent the evening making numerous trips to the bathroom to pass all of the water out of my system.
                  I also visited him several times after having reconstructive surgery. He told me that the massage therapy was great for reducing scar tissue and improving circulation, basically assisting with the healing process.
                  All of those benefits, and it felt great, too.
                  Even a decade later, my healing continues, so whenever I'm a few hundred miles of Phoenix (I used to live in Flagstaff), I can't resist going to see Gene for an appointment. It's totally worth going out of your way to get a healing massage from this him.
